## Machine Learning Section

We have used multiple machine learning algorithms to predict/classify certain metrics of the data.

### Algorithms we have used
- K-Nearest Neighbour Algorithm
- Random Forest Regressor
- Linear Regressor

#### Running
```bash
cd MachineLearning
python BigData.py
```
#### Output and Inferences
##### Output-1
Year of Release vs Number of games. Green part indicates the games which have user and critic count while the IndianRed indicates the ones which do not have the user and critic counts.

##### Output-2
Number of games vs global sale in millions.Green part indicates the games which have user and critic score while the IndianRed indicates the ones which do not have the user and critic score.
